# **Project title** : Hospital Management system

## **Introduction**

This is a .Net application purely using C# within Visual Studio 2019. The aim of the project was to create a system that would be suitable within a hospital environment, to keep patient data organised and manageable.

## **Screenshots**

Below are a few screenshots from the program, which give you an idea of its appearance and the functions it contains. The application has an employee login screen and main menu, which gives the user 10 different options to choose from.

## **What I Learnt**

This is this first project I completed in my masters course at university, which gave me the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the different techniques and coding standards involded in C#:

* FileI/O and serialization
* Variables
* Conditional branching 
* Repetition using loops
* Functions and methods
* Sequential data structures
* Classes
* Searching and sorting data
* Load data from text files
* Load configuration settings
* Interfaces
* Dependency Injection
* Enums

If there’s anything that I’ve taken away from this project, it would be that it taught me how imperative it is for a software engineer to develop the fundamentals of debugging and applying that process to identifying the cause of all errors. It’s a core skill for every developer to have, as it helps improve problem solving skills and saves precious development time. 

## **Potential Future Features**

* Record checkout transactions - generating patient bills. 

* Manage rooms - In hopsotals there are many types of rooms such as A.C rooms, Special rooms, Super deluxe rooms, etc. Patient's would be assigned to a specific room, which could be shown through a colour cordinated GUI. E.g green - avaiable and red- unavailable. 

* Manage doctors - this would include managing their avaliablity and personal details. Each doctor specialises in certain areas which would be imperative to know.

* Weekly reports - Reports are a very important part of any system. these reports would include information such as admitted and discharged patients and bill reports.

* Individual logins for nurses, doctors, and Hospital admin.

* Manage the Data through a database (Microsoft SQL server).

* I would also consider using ASP.Net instead of .Net Framework to deliver a more professional outcome.
